## Project Overview
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a complex condition often treated with stimulant medications, which have proven effective in managing symptoms like inattention and impulsivity but can cause side effects. The question remains whether non-pharmacological interventions, such as neurofeedback, can replicate or enhance the benefits of stimulants in individuals with ADHD.  Additionally, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies in ADHD research have often been hindered by unaccounted motion artifacts, leading to potential inaccuracies in measuring brain activity. Our research aims to address these gaps by improving the methods used to correct for motion in neuroimaging studies and by exploring the potential of neurofeedback as an alternative or complementary treatment for ADHD.
### Our research has two objectives:
(1) We will investigate and address the impact of motion artifacts in fMRI research, particularly in ADHD studies where motion has previously been unmeasured or inadequately accounted for. By incorporating new technology to better capture and correct for motion, and by repeating experiments with this improved capability, we aim to refine our understanding of how motion affects neuroimaging results. 
(2) Our study will explore whether neurofeedback can replicate or enhance the effects of stimulant medications in individuals with ADHD. By comparing brain activity and performance on attention tasks during neurofeedback and stimulant conditions, we aim to determine if neurofeedback can serve as an alternative or complement to stimulants in managing ADHD symptoms. This investigation will contribute to the literature by evaluating the potential of neurofeedback to replicate or amplify the benefits typically associated with stimulant treatments, without the side effects associated with stimulant drugs.
By addressing the impact of motion artifacts and investigating the effects of neurofeedback compared to stimulant medications, our study seeks to refine neuroimaging techniques and expand the understanding of ADHD treatment options. If neurofeedback can replicate or amplify the effects of stimulants on brain activity and attention, it may offer a promising, non-invasive treatment with fewer side effects. Ultimately, this research has the potential to advance both methodological practices in ADHD research and therapeutic approaches for individuals with the condition.
