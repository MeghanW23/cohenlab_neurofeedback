## Project Overview
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a complex condition often treated with stimulant medications, which have proven effective in managing symptoms like inattention and impulsivity but can cause side effects. The question remains whether non-pharmacological interventions, such as neurofeedback, can replicate or enhance the benefits of stimulants in individuals with ADHD.  Additionally, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies in ADHD research have often been hindered by unaccounted motion artifacts, leading to potential inaccuracies in measuring brain activity. Our research aims to address these gaps by improving the methods used to correct for motion in neuroimaging studies and by exploring the potential of neurofeedback as an alternative or complementary treatment for ADHD.
### Our research has two objectives:
#### (1) Address the Impact of Motion on fMRI Results Involving Individuals with ADHD: 
We will investigate and address the impact of motion artifacts in fMRI research, particularly in ADHD studies where motion has previously been unmeasured or inadequately accounted for. By incorporating new technology to better capture and correct for motion, and by repeating experiments with this improved capability, we aim to refine our understanding of how motion affects neuroimaging results. 

#### (2) Address the Feasibility of Neurofeedback as a Method to Replicate the Effects of Stimulants in ADHD
Our study will explore whether neurofeedback can replicate or enhance the effects of stimulant medications in individuals with ADHD. By comparing brain activity and performance on attention tasks during neurofeedback and stimulant conditions, we aim to determine if neurofeedback can serve as an alternative or complement to stimulants in managing ADHD symptoms. This investigation will contribute to the literature by evaluating the potential of neurofeedback to replicate or amplify the benefits typically associated with stimulant treatments, without the side effects associated with stimulant drugs.
By addressing the impact of motion artifacts and investigating the effects of neurofeedback compared to stimulant medications, our study seeks to refine neuroimaging techniques and expand the understanding of ADHD treatment options. If neurofeedback can replicate or amplify the effects of stimulants on brain activity and attention, it may offer a promising, non-invasive treatment with fewer side effects. Ultimately, this research has the potential to advance both methodological practices in ADHD research and therapeutic approaches for individuals with the condition.

## Prerequisites 
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Architecture and OS Requirements**: Our project is designed for macOS machines running on ARM64 architecture. Running the project on other machines will likely require minor adjustments.
- **Docker Installation**: Ensure [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) is installed and configured on your machine.
- **FSL Installation**: [FSL](https://web.mit.edu/fsl_v5.0.10/fsl/doc/wiki/FslInstallation.html) must be installed on your machine for brain registration, visualization, and analysis.
- **VNC Viewer Installation**: To display our tasks to participants, our primary Docker image utilizes a headless virtual display through `Xvfb` and `x11vnc`. To access this virtual display, we recommend the free TigerVNC Viewer from [TigerVNC](https://tigervnc.org/). While macOS includes a built-in VNC Viewer, its performance is often inferior. Other free VNC Viewers are also available online. *This project can be adapted for use with X11 forwarding; however, we have found that using a VNC has yielded better results.*
- **E3 Access**: Ensure you have access to the Enkefalos-v3 Cluster (E3) at Boston Childrenâ€™s Hospital, which is a centrally administered secured high-performance computing (HPC) cluster dedicated to research computing and computational studies on both patient health information (PHI) and non-PHI data. You must have access to the Boston Children's Hospital VPN and have a valid CHID to access. 
- **Samba File Server**: Users must create a [Samba File Server](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-and-configure-samba#1-overview) to facilitate DICOM data transfer from the MRI and the user's machine.
- **Dual Monitors**: It is recommended to work with two monitors, as our tasks treat the MRI's screen, which projects tasks and videos to in-scanner participants, as a second monitor.

*Note: It is also recommended that you install [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/) to move and resize windows in macOS using keyboard shortcuts or snap areas. This makes it easier to send the task window from your macbook screen's display to the mri monitor display.*

## Task Script Descriptions 
#### Neurofeedback Task:
- **Main Script**: [1_Task_NFB.py](https://github.com/MeghanW23/cohenlab_neurofeedback/blob/main/tasks_run/scripts/1_Task_NFB.py)
- **Description**: A real-time neurofeedback task where individuals in the scanner are shown their brain activity in an attention-related brain region of interest (either Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC) or Right Inferior Frontal Gyrus (RIFG)) via a rocket going into a portal. If that brain region becomes more active (i.e. the participant is paying attention more), the rocket gets closer to the portal. If that brain region becomes less active, the rocket gets further from the portal.

## Troubleshooting Steps 
### Siemens 3T Prisma MRI Scanner  
- When working with Boston Children's Siemens 3T Prisma MRI Scanner at 2 Brookline Place, we do the following to create a Samba share that the MRI control computer can connect to:
	- To connect to sambashare, log into **med admin** account. If logged into **med user** the connection will not establish accordingly and the DICOM transfer will be unsuccesful. 
	- To connect to sambashare, go into **File Explorer > This PC > Map Network Drive**, and input the following: 
		- **Drive**: Z:, **Folder**: `//<ip>/<folder>` (replace `<ip>` with the Samba server's IP address and `<folder>` with the folder you are sharing to the MRI machine)
		- Input the **Samba user**  established and the password will be the same if not pre-determined. 
	- Once connected, make sure the same files are shown on **File Explorer** window as on **Macbook**. 
	- If there is a Windows pop-up error, the computer may have to be restarted in order to re-establish the connection. 
	- Add-in configurations for MRI sequences must match the drive and information previously inputted for files to be transferred appropriately: 
		- **Target Host**: Z: (or whichever drive is connected), 
		- **Target Directory**: . (can specify directory or leave as "." to indicate the current directory), 
		- **Username**: `WORKGROUP\<user>` (use the **same user** specified in the **Folder** field prior to this step), 
		- **Password**: `<pre-determined or same as user>` (use the assigned password or the same values as the username if unspecified)
